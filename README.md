# Graphical Models
Code for all the labs from COL776 (PGMs). The repo contains the following

* A1: 

   **Part1:** C++ implementations of a Bayes net followed by code for d-separation. 

   **Part2:** C++ implementation of an MRF followed by exact inference for OCR task.

* A2: Python code for exact (messaging passing) and approximate inference (Loopy BP) in generic MRFs (uses abstractions such as Factors)
* A3: Learning in MRF (Gradient descent along with Gibbs sampling) and Bayes nets (essentially counting).

Hope you find this code useful for your implementations. The code is fairly self documenting. Contact me at shikhar.murty@gmail.com if you have additional queries.
